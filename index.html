          <div class="wysiwyg intro__description">
            <p>Starting from a student with Bachelor of Art in dual-language English & Russian, but I'd love to surfing and learning much from what I did.</p>
            <p>I was a Marketing Manager, a Web Designer and also IT Administrators in several small companies before switching to Sales Manager in Light Technology Viet JSC where I have more rich experience about sales, marketing channel, improving myself about management skill, learning much more about customer support, solving problems and training a team.</p>
            <p>Yes, I was Founders of three (3) startups: UpReseller (200 clients), Hostname.club (100 clients) and DedicatedGuru (50 clients). I don't think I failed with them, but think about my experiences with these brand names. It helps me a lot to improving myself.</p>
            <p>After almost 2 years with web hosting industry, I think my favourite work is coding. I can spent my life to learn more programming languages, creating awesome products and become an expert in this land. Because of that I decided to learn about front-end developing job.</p>
            <p>With my strongest skills as a FRONT-END DEVELOPER and PROJECT MANAGEMENT skills, I joined Solis Lab Co., Ltd. in June 2016 as Technical Lead at Hanoi Branch Office. In this position I believe my strength will be used to help team members found their favourite, upgrade their skills, improving their coding lines and also creating awesome products.</p>
